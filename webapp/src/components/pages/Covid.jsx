            The goal of this project is to propose a data format that allows to build an open database of web entities that repeatedly share misinformation, starting with the topic of COVID-19. <br />
            This should prove useful to Internet users who want to be aware of whether the content they are viewing is likely misleading, and web platforms that want to prevent their recommendation algorithms from pushing misinformation to their users.
